# Plot the validation and training curves separatly
def plot_loss_curves(history):
    """
    Plots the loss and accuracy curves for training and validation.

    This function takes a TensorFlow History object as input and generates two plots: one for the loss and the other for the accuracy. It automatically distinguishes between training and validation metrics based on the keys in the History object, accommodating different metric names.

    Parameters:
    - history (History): The History object obtained from the `fit` method of a TensorFlow/Keras model. It contains record of loss values and metrics values at successive epochs, as well as validation loss values and validation metrics values (if applicable).

    Returns:
    None. This function directly plots the loss and accuracy curves using Matplotlib, splitting the loss and accuracy into separate plots for better clarity.
